# Quick Start - OpenAI (5 minutes)

Get Open Notebook running with OpenAI's GPT models. Fast, powerful, and simple.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker Desktop** installed
   - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Already have it? Skip to step 2

2. **OpenAI API Key** (required)
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create account → Create new secret key
   - Add at least $5 in credits to your account
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

## Step 1: Create Configuration (1 min)

Create a new folder `open-notebook` and add this file:

**docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
services:
  seekdb:
    image: oceanbase/seekdb:latest
    entrypoint:
      - /bin/bash
      - /root/seekdb-start-fixed.sh
    ports:
      - "2881:2881"
      - "2886:2886"
    environment:
      - ROOT_PASSWORD=${SEEKDB_ROOT_PASSWORD:-SeekDBRoot123!}
      - SEEKDB_DATABASE=${SEEKDB_DATABASE:-open_notebook_ai}
    volumes:
      - seekdb_data:/var/lib/oceanbase
      - ./scripts/seekdb-start-fixed.sh:/root/seekdb-start-fixed.sh:ro
    restart: always

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: redis-server --save "" --appendonly no
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    restart: always

  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open_notebook:v1-latest
    pull_policy: always
    ports:
      - "8502:8502"  # Web UI
      - "5055:5055"  # REST API
    environment:
      # REQUIRED: Encryption key for credential storage
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-me-to-a-secret-string

      # Database (SeekDB with MySQL protocol)
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_SEEKDB_DSN=${OPEN_NOTEBOOK_SEEKDB_DSN:-mysql://root:SeekDBRoot123%21@seekdb:2881/open_notebook_ai}
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_AI_CONFIG_BACKEND=seekdb
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_SEARCH_BACKEND=seekdb
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_JOB_BACKEND=arq
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
    volumes:
      - ./notebook_data:/app/data
    depends_on:
      - seekdb
      - redis
    restart: always

volumes:
  seekdb_data:
```

**Edit the file:**
- Replace `change-me-to-a-secret-string` with your own secret (any string works)
- Create a `scripts/` folder in your project directory with the [seekdb-start-fixed.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfnovo/open-notebook/main/scripts/seekdb-start-fixed.sh) script, or remove the entrypoint override if not needed.

- [ ] You can access `http://localhost:8502`
- [ ] OpenAI credential is configured and tested
- [ ] You created a notebook
- [ ] You added a source
- [ ] Chat works

**All checked?** You have a fully working AI research assistant!

## Using Different Models

In your notebook, go to **Settings** → **Models** to choose:
- `gpt-4o` - Best quality (recommended)
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Fast and cheap (good for testing)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 8502 already in use"

Change the port in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8503:8502"  # Use 8503 instead
```

Then access at `http://localhost:8503`

### "API key not working"

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Test Connection** on your OpenAI credential
3. If it fails, verify your key at https://platform.openai.com
4. Delete the credential and create a new one with the correct key

### "Cannot connect to server"

```bash
docker ps  # Check all services running
docker compose logs  # View logs
docker compose restart  # Restart everything
```
