- i18n support for Bengali (bn-IN) (#643)
- Podcast language support via podcast-creator 0.12.0 (#645)
- Upgrade default Azure API version for model testing and fetching (#638)

### Fixed
- Tiktoken network errors in offline/air-gapped Docker deployments — pre-downloads encoding at build time (#264, #622)
- SurrealDB getting stuck (#656)

### Dependencies
- Bump esperanto to 2.19.5 (#657)
- Bump langgraph from 1.0.6 to 1.0.10rc1 (#658)

## [1.7.4] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Embedding large documents (3MB+) fails with 413 Payload Too Large (#594)
- `generate_embeddings()` now batches texts in groups of 50 with per-batch retry, preventing provider payload limits from being exceeded
- 413 errors now classified with user-friendly message in error classifier
- Misleading "Created 0 embedded chunks" log in `process_source_command` — embedding is fire-and-forget, so the count was always 0; now logs "embedding submitted" instead

## [1.7.3] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Retry button for failed podcast episodes in the UI (#211, #218)
- Error details displayed on failed podcast episodes (#185, #355)
- `POST /podcasts/episodes/{id}/retry` API endpoint for re-submitting failed episodes

- Disabled automatic retries for podcast generation to prevent duplicate episode records (#302)

### Dependencies
- Bump podcast-creator to >= 0.11.2
- Bump esperanto to >= 2.19.4

### Added
- Error classification utility that maps LLM provider errors to user-friendly messages (#506)
- Global exception handlers in FastAPI for all custom exception types with proper HTTP status codes
- `getApiErrorMessage()` frontend helper that falls back to backend messages when no i18n mapping exists

### Fixed
- LLM errors (invalid API key, wrong model, rate limits) now show descriptive messages instead of "An unexpected error occurred" (#590)
- SSE streaming error events in source chat and ask hooks were swallowed by inner JSON parse catch blocks
- Transformation execution errors were caught and re-wrapped as generic 500s instead of using proper status codes
- Fail fast when source content extraction returns empty instead of retrying (#589)
- Chat input and message overflow with long unbroken strings (#588)

### Changed
- `ValueError` replaced with `ConfigurationError` in model provisioning for proper error classification

### Added
- **Credential-Based Provider Management** (#477)
  - New Settings → API Keys page for managing AI provider credentials via the UI
  - Support for 14 providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, OpenRouter, Voyage AI, ElevenLabs, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI-Compatible, and Vertex AI
  - Secure storage of API keys in SurrealDB with field-level encryption (Fernet AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
  - One-click connection testing, model discovery, and model registration per credential
  - Migration tool to import existing environment variable keys into the credential system
  - Azure OpenAI support with service-specific endpoints (LLM, Embedding, STT, TTS)
  - OpenAI-Compatible support with per-service URL configurations
  - Vertex AI support with project, location, and credentials path

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Docker secrets support via `_FILE` suffix pattern (e.g., `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD_FILE`)

  - Default password "open-notebook-change-me" for out-of-box experience (change in production!)
  - URL validation for SSRF protection - blocks private IPs and localhost (except for Ollama which runs locally)
  - Security warnings logged when using default credentials

- HTML clipboard detection for text sources (#426)
  - When pasting content, automatically detects HTML format (e.g., from Word, web pages)
  - Shows info message when HTML is detected, informing user it will be converted to Markdown
  - Preserves formatting that would be lost with plain text paste
  - Bump content-core to 0.11.0 for HTML to Markdown conversion support

- **Improved Getting Started Experience**
  - Simplified docker-compose.yml in repository root (single official file)
  - Added examples/ folder with ready-made configurations:
    - `docker-compose-ollama.yml` - Local AI with Ollama
    - `docker-compose-speaches.yml` - Local TTS/STT with Speaches
    - `docker-compose-full-local.yml` - 100% local setup (Ollama + Speaches)
  - Inline quick start in README (no need to navigate to docs)
  - Cross-references between docker-compose examples and documentation
  - .env.example template with all configuration options

### Fixed
- Azure form race condition: all configuration now saved in single atomic request
